\ reducing a string to a word key:
\ each letter of the word occupies 5 bits, A=00001, B=00010, â€¦ Z=11010
\ the letter value 31 has a special meaning of wildcard letter
\ to describe a neighbor group
\ the first 2 bits of the word key give it's number of letters:
\ 01: 3 letter word, 10: 4 letter word, 11:five letter word

\ forming a word key involve extracting all the chars from a string,
\ reversing them, converting them in letter values, then folding them
\ in single integer value by LSHIFTing and ORing.

\ given a word key, we can find its neighbor groups
\ for example the word CARD has the neighbor groups :
\ _ARD, C_RD, CA_D, and CAR_
\ each neighbor group is a word key, and we can attach
\ letters that complement the word key to form a full word
\ for instance, since we have the word CARD, we know that
\ the neighbor group _CARD exist, with the letter C attached
\ when/if we see the word LARD, we can add the letter L to 
\ the neighbor group _ARD
